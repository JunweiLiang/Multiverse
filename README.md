# Introduction

    This paper proposes the first multi-future pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset and a multi-future prediction method called Multiverse.
  </p>
</div>

This paper studies the problem of predicting the distribution over multiple possible future paths of people as they move through various visual scenes. We make two main contributions. The first contribution is a new dataset called the **Forking Paths Dataset**, created in a realistic 3D simulator, which is based on real world trajectory data, and then extrapolated by human annotators to achieve different latent goals. This provides the **first benchmark** for quantitative evaluation of the models to predict **multi-future trajectories**.

# The Forking Paths Dataset

+ Current dataset version: v1

+ Download links: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yESCQuIdiDNanUSX0qDyzbBRe_AeZB5a/view?usp=sharing) ([sha256sum](https://next.cs.cmu.edu/multiverse/dataset/ForkingPaths_dataset_v1.sha256sum.txt))

+ The dataset includes 3000 1920x1080 videos (750 human-annotated trajectory samples in 4 camera views) with bounding boxes and scene semantic segmentation ground truth. More notes and instructions about the dataset can be found [here](forking_paths_dataset/README.md#annotations).

+ Instructions of how to add more human annotations, edit the scenes, recreate from real-world videos, or **just simply to play with 3D simulator**, can be found [here](forking_paths_dataset/README.md#record-more-annotations).

+ Instructions of how to semi-automatically **re-create real-world videos' scenarios** with homography matrices into 3D simulation can be found [here](forking_paths_dataset/README.md#recreate-scenarios-from-real-world-videos).

Our second contribution is a new model to generate multiple plausible future trajectories, which contains novel designs of using multi-scale location encodings and convolutional RNNs over graphs. We refer to our model as Multiverse.
